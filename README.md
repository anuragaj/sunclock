sunclock
========

This is a simple project written in c++ using OpenGL which demonstrates the working of sunclock.

System requirements to run this project are:
1.Microsoft windows xp or higher
2.Microsoft Visual studio 2005 or higher.
3.OpenGL header files

I submitted this project as mini project in my 6th sem B.E,Shridevi Institute of Engineering and Technology
under VTU Belgaum.

How to Run:
1.Download the folder finalrun.
2.Import that from visual studio(windows32 console application).
3.Download the header files from headerfilesX(32 or 64) according to your machine bit configuration.
4.Then copy the different header files to specific path(refer the "howtocopy.txt" from that folder).

OR
1.Download the "code.cpp".
2.Then create a project(File->new->Visual C++->windows32 application->(next)->empty application,console application->(finish).
3.Then add the file code.cpp to that folder.
4.Copy the contents from "code.txt" to that file.

finish, now you can run the project!!!!
